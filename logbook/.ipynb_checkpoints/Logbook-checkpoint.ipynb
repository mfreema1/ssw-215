    "Using HTML was pretty easy since I've been fairly experienced with web development and it's only a markup language after all.  Use of CSS in a separate document was banned, so inline styling had to be used which didn't make for some eloquent code but it came out alright at just under 100 lines.  I'm pretty confident I accomplished what was asked of me, although the guidelines for the project seemed somewhat vague.  I think this will improve as the projects get more difficult, and I think I'll really appreciate the challenge."

    "We accomplished this on my Linux machine.  Since Visual Studio Code does not have a C++ compiler built into it, we installed g++ via `apt get`.  Then we simply ran it from the terminal using `./a.out`.  This is because `a` is the default output file for g++.  I really enjoy programming in C++, so I'm looking forward to some more complicated concepts."

Overall, this was about 50 lines of CSS over the course of an hour.  Most of the time was spent rearranging and pulling previous inline styles from the html and hoisting them up to the nearest parent element."
