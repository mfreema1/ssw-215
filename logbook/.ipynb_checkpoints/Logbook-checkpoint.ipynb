    "Using HTML was pretty easy since I've been fairly experienced with web development and it's only a markup language after all.  Use of CSS in a separate document was banned, so inline styling had to be used which didn't make for some eloquent code but it came out alright at just under 100 lines.  I'm pretty confident I accomplished what was asked of me, although the guidelines for the project seemed somewhat vague.  I think this will improve as the projects get more difficult, and I think I'll really appreciate the challenge."

Then we simply ran it from the terminal using `./a.out`.  This is because `a` is the default output file for g++.  I really enjoy programming in C++, so I'm looking forward to some more complicated concepts."

Overall, this was about 50 lines of CSS over the course of an hour.  Most of the time was spent rearranging and pulling previous inline styles from the html and hoisting them up to the nearest parent element."

During this, we will be working through a Udacity course focused around some pretty advanced web development.  Today I took quite a bit of notes (around 2 hours) on the benefits of creating applications with spotty connections in mind.  This is called _offline-first development._\n",

The odds are looking good, I believe it's around 10% admittance from here into that program, and around that many students will probably finish the course, as pass rates for these online courses are generally low, so things are looking up."

Setting up a service worker is actually pretty easy, and the idea of scoping a service worker to control what specific URL's it interacts with is a nice feature.  Will continue work on this clone soon."
