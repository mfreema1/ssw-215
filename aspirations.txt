During my time in college, I think my main goal would be to mature as a programmer/project overseer.  I want to be more methodical with my programming, planning projects before writing them with clear practices and patterns in mind.  I'd like to be able to weigh the pros and cons of certain patterns, and adjust my choices to the project at hand.  I'd like to write readable code that is sophisticated and debuggable.  I'd like to know at least one language very well, rather than learning very little about a variety of languages.

At the time of writing, I am stuck between going into machine learning or web/mobile development.  If I go down the development path, I'd like to learn more how software stacks fit together, and possibly attain a Google certification in Android development, as well as to attain my CompTIA A+, Network+, Linux+, and Project+ certifications, perhaps with some additional developer certifications as well.

If I go the machine learning path, I'd like to be able to understand machine learning at a fundamental level, not just learning the frameworks and how to feed data into them.  I'd also like to have a strong understanding of the data life cycle, through acquisition, cleaning, and ultimately using data.  I'd also like to know how to implement convoluted and recurrent neural networks, with an understanding of how both work.
