                    <hr>
                    <p>Hi! I'm actually a project created in one month 
                    by two developers at Stevens Institute of Technology!  I was
                    made as an introductory effort in Django with no prior knowledge
                    of the framework, so please excuse any mistakes you may find during
                    use.  In fact, if you find any bugs, please send them along to
                    Mark at <a href="mailto:mfreema1@stevens.edu">his email.</a>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I'm currently in prototype stages and am being offered as a free
                    service for people to keep track of their lives via the web.  We
                    wanted to operate off of a similar model to some popular planning
                    systems in print, so that's essentially what we ported to web
                    through this project.  At it's heart, this is a CRUD application,
                    so Django was chosen to facilitate much of the effort of those
                    operations. (This project had a deadline after all!)
